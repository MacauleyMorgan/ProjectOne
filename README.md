# ProjectOne

Project for a crossfit gym made for educational purposes to complete milestone project one for Code Institute.

The project should have an easily navigateable design to ensure that the user experience is available to keyboard navigators as well as mouse users.

Landing page

The user story on the landing page should grab the users attention and explain what the project is built for and this is why th hero image of the project is largely sized to grab the users attention. The hero image is also a clickable link to the Find a Class page as a call to action for the user.

Pricing Cards

The pricing cards on the landing page were created with clear context and allow for a user to see the pricing information of the company, these cards also overlap the hero image and the information below the image to suggest that the page can be scrolled to display more information. The cards are tabable and the prices are anchor tags to act as a link to a potential ecommerce section.

The cards are then followed by a short description of the locations of the company premises to inform the user of the available locations in an unordered list.

Meet the PT's

This section is designed to allow the user to know the instructor teams on a more personal level and provide a short paragraph on specialities of the training team. This will add to the user experience as it will help them identify the correct trainer for their goals.

Find a Class

The Find a Class user story is designed to be a call to action for the user and displays the class information via table with clickable anchor tags that will redirect the user to a confirmation screen for the class (register.html). The table is then followed by a newsletter for the user to gain additional information via mailing list and this is linked to a form dump provided by Code Institute. The inputs inside the newsletter are coded to be a required feild for user input in order to display the form dump.
